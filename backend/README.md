API Testing with Postman
This repository includes a Postman collection for testing the API endpoints.

Import Instructions:

Download Postman

In Postman, click the "Import" button

Select the Pixisphere-API.postman_collection.json file from the /postman folder

Create an environment with a baseUrl variable pointing to your API (e.g., http://localhost:5000)

Run the API tests

Key API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /api/auth/signup - Register a new user

POST /api/auth/login - Login and get JWT token

POST /api/auth/verify-otp - Verify OTP code

GET /api/auth/me - Get current user profile

Partner
POST /api/partner/onboard - Submit partner information for verification

GET /api/partner/profile - Get partner profile

GET /api/partner/leads - Get assigned leads

Portfolio
POST /api/partner/portfolio - Add portfolio item

GET /api/partner/portfolio - Get all portfolio items

Role-Based Access
The system supports three user roles with different permissions:

Client: Can create inquiries, view responses from partners

Partner: Can create a profile, manage portfolio, respond to inquiries

Admin: Can verify partners, manage system settings, moderate content

Deployment
This API is configured for deployment on Vercel. It can also be deployed to any Node.js hosting platform like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.

Security Considerations
All routes except authentication endpoints are protected with JWT

Role-based middleware ensures proper access control

Passwords are hashed using bcrypt

Rate limiting prevents abuse
